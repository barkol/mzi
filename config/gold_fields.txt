# Gold Fields Configuration
# These fields award 100 points Ã— beam intensity when beams pass through
# Format: grid_x,grid_y
# Grid coordinates start at 0,0 (top-left of canvas)
# Canvas is 20x15 grid cells (800x600 pixels with 40px grid)
# Lines starting with # are comments

# IMPORTANT: A field cannot be both blocked AND gold!
# If a position appears in both blocked_fields.txt and gold_fields.txt,
# the blocked field takes precedence (the position will be blocked, not gold).

# Example: Strategic gold field placements

# Upper path rewards

# Lower path rewards

# Note: Gold fields can overlap with component positions
# The bonus is awarded based on beam paths, not component placement
